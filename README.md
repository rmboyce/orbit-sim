# Orbit Simulator
Simple orbit simulator in Processing - ignores interactions between planets. Uses the Kepler Equation to solve the two-body problem to find where the planets should be and what speeds they should be moving at.  
Uses three clicks: The first click sets the orbit radius, the second sets the eccentricity, and the third sets the planet radius.
