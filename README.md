# Orbit Simulator
Simple orbit simulator in Processing - ignores interactions between planets. It finds where the planets should be and what speeds they should be moving at by solving the two-body problem with the Kepler Equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation).
Uses three clicks: The first two clicks set the orbit, and the third sets the planet radius.
